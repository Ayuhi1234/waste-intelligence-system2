# 🗓️ Intern Onboarding Sprint: Week 1

## 🎯 Sprint Goal
**"Ship a Vertical Slice."**
By Friday 5:00 PM, the Frontend Intern should see a bin update on their screen based on a prediction generated by the ML Intern's script.

## 👥 Roles & Responsibilities

### 🎨 Frontend Intern (Focus: Integration)
* **Objective:** Build the Operations Dashboard.
* **Constraint:** Do not write custom CSS unless necessary. Use Tailwind utility classes.
* **Learning Goal:** Understand how to consume REST APIs and handle async state in React.

**Day-by-Day:**
* **Mon:** Project initialization. deploying a "Hello World" page to Render.
* **Tue:** Build `BinCard` and `BinGrid` components using mock JSON data.
* **Wed:** Replace mock data with real API calls (`axios` or `fetch`).
* **Thu:** Add "Last Updated" timestamp and auto-refresh logic (every 30s).
* **Fri:** Demo day! Show the live dashboard to the team.

### 🧠 ML Intern (Focus: Pipeline)
* **Objective:** Build the Prediction Service.
* **Constraint:** No Deep Learning or Neural Networks for Week 1. Stick to Scikit-Learn.
* **Learning Goal:** Understand how to package a model so a backend engineer can actually use it.

**Day-by-Day:**
* **Mon:** Write a `generate_data.py` script to create realistic waste patterns.
* **Tue:** Data cleaning and feature engineering (e.g., "Day of Week", "Hour").
* **Wed:** Train a Logistic Regression model (`fill_level` -> `pickup_probability`).
* **Thu:** Serialize the model using `joblib` or `pickle`. Write a `predict.py` script.
* **Fri:** Work with me (Founding Engineer) to trigger this script from the Node.js API.

## 🛡️ My Role (Founding Engineer)
* **Morning Standup (15 min):** Unblock issues immediately.
* **Code Review:** Review Pull Requests twice daily (Before Lunch, End of Day).
* **Pair Programming:** Scheduled 1-hour sessions if they are stuck for >2 hours.
